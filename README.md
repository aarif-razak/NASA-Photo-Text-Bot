# NASA-Photo-Text-Bot
Built a bot to learn about Flask, APIs, Heroku, and alot about Python and Environment Variables. 


Project and details avaliable at: https://nasa-sms-app.herokuapp.com/


EDIT: If the NASA bot returns a "none" value, it is the server being one day ahead! This is due to NASA's own server hosting. If you want the photo of a specific day, be sure to text using a specific date!
